mysqldbsync
===========

Tools written at a terrible time

syncdb.py copies missing rows between two databases based on missing primary keys

replicationsync.py repeatedly skips duplicate row replication errors to bring replication back in sync.

These are _NOT GENERALLY SAFE_, but can help automate recovery of _SOME_ types of cluster partitioning.

mysqlsnapshot.py is useful for creating snapshots to copy to remote replicas and supports both LVM and btrfs snapshots. This does not mean I think it's wise to use btrfs under your MySQL production cluster.
